# Introduction

A try to port [Heimer](https://github.com/juzzlin/Heimer) mindmap port to web

found some problem

- build qt as https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/wasm.html , will lose `rlelease` command which for translation, so this build I don't add translation file in `Heimer.pro` file
- can't input chinese, copy also not work
- can't save file to local and can't upload file
